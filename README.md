# GNNs-LLMs-Research
This study aims to integrate Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to process complex graph data before being used by Large Language Models (LLMs), in order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the output. By using a GNN-based pipeline to generate embeddings utilized by LLMs, this study explores interoperability, computational efficiency evaluation, and accuracy of the generated text. The study is conducted through experiments with graph datasets such as Freebase and text datasets such as SQuAD, using the PyTorch Geometric framework and Hugging Face Transformers. The pipeline is evaluated based on time efficiency and accuracy compared to traditional approaches. This study provides a foundation for modular applications across domains, while addressing challenges such as data alignment and model optimization.
